; CINV after memory changed behind the CPU, and MOVES straight behind the
; MOVEC that sets its space.
;
; protocol with the testbench (tb_ap040_program.v, tb_ap040_pipe_program.v):
;   word write to $F100 = failing test number
;   word write to $F102 = $BAD0 on failure, $600D when all tests passed
;   word write to $F130 = DMA-style poke: $3500 := data, $3502 := 0, behind
;                         the CPU's back (no store the CPU could snoop)
;   byte write to $F120 must carry FC=1
;
; Test 1-4: code at $3500 is fetched, rewritten by the DMA poke, and run
; again. The poke is not a CPU store to $3500, so nothing but CINVA can make
; the new instruction visible: a prefetch stream, a queue or an I-cache that
; kept the old one runs MOVEQ #1 where MOVEQ #2 is now. CINVA is followed by
; the code straight away, so what was fetched behind the CINVA itself has to
; go too.
;
; Test 5: MOVEC D0,DFC straight ahead of MOVES.B, so the MOVES reaches the
; point where it uses DFC as the MOVEC commits.
