"""Run the pipelined core's milestone benches under Verilator.

Upstream ships tb/run_pipe_tests.sh, which drives iverilog. This project
uses Verilator only. Nothing in the benches themselves needed changing:
each pokes its own program into ap040_inst_fetch.v's ROM at time 0, so
there is no assembler dependency and no 4-state X requirement.

tb_ap040_pipe_l1_wbuf tests ap040_pipe_l1.v standalone, so it gets only
that file; compiling it against the full list would put two
top-level-instantiable modules in one unit. tb_ap040_pipe_alu_equiv
compares ap040_pipe_alu.v against the FSM core's rtl/ap040/ap040_alu.v,
so it gets those two files and both include directories.
