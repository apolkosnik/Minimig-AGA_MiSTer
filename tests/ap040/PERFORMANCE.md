# AP040 performance branch: 40 MHz 68040 target

Branch: `ap040-40mhz`. Baseline: `a48b5c30` (the previously validated
working-tree configuration, following upstream merge `b004dbd9`).

**The 40 MHz 68040 performance target is not yet achieved.** The hardware
configuration still clocks the CPU at approximately 28 MHz. Higher CPU rates
below are functional simulations, not timing-closed FPGA configurations.
A matching real-machine benchmark/result is needed to establish parity.

## Enabled optimizations

* Read decoded register operands directly during setup, removing the extra
  register-index copy and operand-read state.
* Start simple indirect/postincrement/predecrement address handling without an
  extra dispatch state. Architectural address updates and fault rollback use
  the existing path.
* Consume a resident next opcode when a simple register operation completes.
  Trace and interrupt checks still precede dispatch; A7, SR and complex
  completions retain their writeback barrier.
* Pair MMU sweep data with its actual BRAM read address. The BRAM runs while
  CPU enables are paused; the old sweep could inspect a different row after
  an enable gap and miss a page flush.
* Drain all four controller burst beats for uncached reads. An early CPU
  acknowledgement no longer allows another read to consume the old burst's
  remaining words.
* Factor the late chipset-idle signal out of the CD DMA address-class muxes.
  All 17 outputs matched the original arbiter across 100,000 randomized
  Verilator cycles. Explicit buffer cells give the retained CD DMA word
  propagation delay without adding a bus cycle. The 0.25 ns minimum-delay
  requirement tightens hold timing relative to the baseline constraints.

## Measured core throughput

Verilator 5.052; freshly assembled, self-checking programs; internal caches
enabled. These are elapsed simulation clock counts, including startup and
verification. They are not scores from a physical Amiga.

| Workload | Baseline, phase 0 | Optimized, phase 0 | Throughput increase |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `bench_alu`: 65,536 dependent ALU operations | 330,846 | 200,190 | 65.3% |
| `bench_loop`: cached loads, adds and branches | 325,895 | 262,367 | 24.2% |

With variable external wait states (phases 1 and 2), the ALU benchmark changes
from 331,608 to 200,952 cycles; the load/branch benchmark changes from 326,673
to 263,145. The ALU workload includes a Python-checkable recurrence and checks
both final registers, so reading stale operands cannot produce a false win.

## Experimental clock interface

`cpu_wrapper.FAST_CLOCK=1` accepts the memory clock, with `CORE_DIV=4`, `2`
or `1`. `clk_peripheral` remains the original 28 MHz clock. The chip-bus FSM
uses phase edges; RAM consumption has a synchronous select/acknowledge
handoff; RTG/IDE/Akiko completion crosses from the peripheral clock through
a retained acknowledgement. Peripheral writes are accepted on that clock
before the fast CPU can retire them.

The corresponding test benches enable `ram_cs_guard.SAME_CLOCK` and connect
the walker bridge to the CPU clock. **Minimig.sv does not enable this mode.**
Connecting the core to 114 MHz requires real timing closure, including the
free-running BRAM lookup/snoop logic and the peripheral crossings. Applying
a blanket four-cycle timing exception would incorrectly relax those paths.

Functional runs pass at divide four, two and one. Coverage includes:

* Integer, exception, MMU and FPU programs through the real chip/RTG blocks,
  with DMA wait slots, turbo chip RAM, RAM latency variations, and different
  peripheral clock phases.
* Integer/MMU/FPU through SDRAM at divide two.
* Integer/MMU/FPU through the combined SDRAM/DDR model at divide one;
  MMU/FPU at divide four.

The SDRAM/dual-memory benches do not implement the exception suite's full
interrupt-injection interface. Run `t_exceptions` in the core/chip benches.

## Regression evidence

* Core integer, exceptions, MMU, cache, FPU and both benchmarks pass; the
  original six programs pass all three bus-latency phases.
* Production clock configuration passes chip-bus integer/exception/MMU/FPU,
  SDRAM integer/MMU/FPU, and combined SDRAM/DDR integer/MMU/FPU tests.
* The controller-cache unit regression passes. Its new early-restart case
  fails with 24 errors against the baseline controller and passes after the
  burst-drain fix.
* Reset, double fault, walker CDC, bus-gap and bus-timeout unit checks use
  Verilator as well.
* Full v20 corpus A/B: **1,265/1,911 pass and 646 fail in both versions**;
  no timeouts or harness errors. Every slice's status and reported mismatch
  lines are identical. This is regression equivalence, not a clean corpus
  result; the older success counts elsewhere in the repository do not
  describe the current baseline. An additional 494-slice integer sample
  comparison also has identical results.

## Reproduce

Use Verilator; the legacy `run_tests.sh` invokes Icarus and is not used here.

## Remaining work toward 40 MHz 68040 parity

The first fitter run still limits the CPU clock to about 28.9 MHz; its
critical internal path runs from instruction decode to exception-format
selection. Retiming that logic and other long paths is necessary before
activating a higher CPU clock. The shared fetch/data port, branch refill
cost, and narrow external bus remain additional throughput limits. The
dependent integer benchmark is about three clocks per operation; at
114 MHz that would approach 38 million operations per second, but this is
an extrapolation, not demonstrated board performance or universal 040 parity.

Scaler and shadowmask sources match the pre-optimization baseline. The
scaler-specific synthesis assignments, HDMI fitter uncertainty override,
and subsequent fitter-seed experiments have been reverted. CPU and DMA
optimizations remain enabled, with seed 1 and all-corner timing analysis.
The replacement RBF was built from `07ed97cf` on 2026-09-07 at 19:05 EDT
using Quartus Prime 17.0 Lite (zero compilation errors, 152 warnings).
The scaler/video reversion is included in this artifact.

**This RBF is not timing closed.** Across the four timing corners, HDMI setup
slack is -0.474 ns at 100 C and -0.360 ns at -40 C in the slow model. The
other 158 summary entries are nonnegative; worst hold slack is +0.072 ns.
TimeQuest also reports that setup/hold requirements are not fully constrained.
No further scaler or HDMI timing changes were made. Board testing has not
been performed.
