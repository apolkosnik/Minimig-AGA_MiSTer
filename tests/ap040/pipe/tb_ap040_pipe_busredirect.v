// Driven directly rather than through the core, for the same reason        //
// tb_ap040_pipe_l1_wbuf.v drives the array directly: the events under test //
// are COINCIDENCES, and the only way to test a coincidence is to create    //
// it. Reaching one through a program means waiting for a mispredict to     //
// land on the exact cycle a fetch is acknowledged, which depends on the    //
// memory latency of the day.                                               //
//                                                                          //
// Instruction fetch is restartable. A new en_a abandons whatever was in    //
// flight and asks for the new address, which is what the array does and    //
// what ap040_inst_fetch.v assumes when a branch redirects it. Milestone 92 //
// found the wrapper publishing the abandoned word when the redirect came   //
// in the acknowledgement's own cycle, and cancelling the new request with  //
// it. Since the prefetch stream (2026-09-24) the bridge reads aligned      //
// longwords into a four-entry window, answers a request from the window    //
// when it can, and reads ahead on its own; the memory here answers every   //
// read with the whole longword, as a 32-bit bus does. Each word names its  //
// own address: $Cnnn, nnn the word index in an 8 KB image the address     //
// space aliases onto.                                                      //
//                                                                          //
//   0. Out of reset, with no request: the bus stays idle. pf_base is zero  //
//      then, and the stream fetched $0 unasked (review 15) -- on a bus     //
//      where $0 never answers, the reset PC's fetch waited behind it for   //
//      ever.                                                               //
//   1. A plain fetch of $400: the first transaction is that longword, as  //
//      an instruction read, and the word arrives.                          //
//   2. Request $1000, and in the cycle the bus acknowledges it, request    //
//      $800. The word for $1000 must NOT become valid, and $800 must go    //
//      out on the bus afterwards.                                          //
//   3. The sequential pattern. $400 misses; $402 is in the longword just   //
//      returned and must be answered without a second read of it; $404 is //
//      requested in the very cycle its prefetch is acknowledged and must   //
//      be answered from the arriving longword; $408 is requested while its //
//      prefetch is on the bus and must wait for that read, not issue       //
//      another.                                                            //
//   4. Writes into a window that spans the top of the address space       //
//      (review 15). A stream from $FFFFFFF8 holds $FFFFFFF8, $FFFFFFFC,   //
//      $0 and $4: a word written at $FFFFFFFC, then one written at $0,    //
//      must each be what the next fetch there returns. Then a stream from //
//      $0 and a longword written at $FFFFFFFE, which touches the window    //
//      only with its second half.                                          //
//   5. Controls, away from the top: a write outside a full window leaves   //
//      it full (nothing is read again), a longword at $3FE reaches into a  //
//      window at $400 with its second half, a word inside one at $408, a   //
//      word at $410 just past a full window at $400 leaves it full, and a  //
//      longword at $40E reaches its last longword with its first half.    //
