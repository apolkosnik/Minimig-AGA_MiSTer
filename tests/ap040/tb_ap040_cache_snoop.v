// tb_ap040_cache_snoop.v -- directed bench for ap040_cache's snoop and
// port-B arbitration paths (audit findings 5.1-5.3).  These are exactly
// the paths with no other coverage: every other bench ties s_stb low.
//
// The bench drives the cache DIRECTLY: a flat memory model with a fixed
// read latency sits on the m_* side, the c_* side is exercised with
// read/write tasks, ce can be held low for chosen windows, and snoops
// are single-clk pulses INDEPENDENT of ce -- the shape cpu_wrapper's
// snoop CDC actually delivers.
//
//   T1 (5.1)  a snoop landing in a ce-frozen window must still
//             invalidate: the following read of changed memory must
//             miss and refetch.
//   T2 (5.2a) a snoop hitting the set of an in-flight fill must not be
//             undone by the fill's tag writeback, and the snooped way
//             must not be revalidated with stale data.  Swept across
//             the whole fill window.
//   T3 (5.2c) a snoop in the same cycle a lookup is accepted must not
//             let that lookup serve the killed line.  Swept.
//   T4 (5.3)  a snoop displacing a line-crossing store's invalidates
//             must not lose either set.  Swept.
//   T5 (5.4)  a bus error during a line fill (or a passed access) must
//             abandon the transfer instead of re-issuing it forever,
//             must not validate the partly-filled line, and must leave
//             the cache able to serve the exception handler's own
//             accesses.  The error is swept across all four beats.
//   T11       write-through with update-on-hit: a store that fits in a
//             longword and hits leaves the line valid with the store
//             merged in, at every size and lane; a missing store does
//             not allocate; a snoop on the store's set anywhere between
//             acceptance and the ack leaves the line dead, a snoop on
//             another set in that window does not stop the merge.
//             Swept at every memory latency.
//
// Every test reprograms memory behind the cache and requires the next
// read to return the NEW value: a stale cached longword is the failure
// signature throughout.

//                     Must PASS: this is the multicycle argument in
//                     Minimig.sdc, and if it is wrong T3 fails here.
//   +inj_acc_whole    the same term blind for the WHOLE acceptance wait.
//   +inj_look_whole   the compare-cycle term blind for the WHOLE C_LOOK
//                     window.
//
// Measured under -DSNOOP_MIXED_X (the silicon-faithful tag-row model; with
// the default old-data answer a snoop's invalidate is simply read back a
// cycle later and neither guard is ever load-bearing):
//
//                        CE_DIV 1        CE_DIV 4
//   guard intact         PASS            PASS

//   +inj_look_whole      PASS            FAIL
//   +inj_acc_settle      FAIL (=whole)   PASS
//
// Each term is load-bearing in one regime and redundant in the other, and
// the reasons are the cycle counts.  At divide 1 the compare is the cycle
// after the read is issued, so a snoop in the acceptance cycle collides
// with that read and the compare sees garbage: the ACCEPTANCE term is what
// forces the miss.  At divide 4 the compare is four cycles later and the
// tag row is re-read every cycle, so that collision is cleaned before it
// is looked at -- the acceptance term can be arbitrarily late, which is
// what Minimig.sdc's relaxation of core|mem_addr -> look_snooped needs --
// while a snoop inside the four-cycle C_LOOK window can still land after
// the last re-read the compare will see: the COMPARE term is what forces
// the miss there, and blinding it lets a garbage victim way through to
// C_TAGW (the +inj_look_whole failure is that chain).  So the split is
// not just safe but required, and the relaxation is proven by a control
// that fails where the regime is different.  The suite carries the two
// failing controls as neglegs, one per divide.
//   +inj_fillguard    blind the WRITEBACK protection as well -- tag_we's
//                     !fill_snooped && !snoop_fill_row (ap040_cache.v:439),
//                     which is a separate guard from the lookup terms above.
//                     For diagnosis only: it exists to tell overlapping
//                     protection apart from a redundant term.  Corruption
//                     that appears only when this AND a lookup term are
//                     blinded shows the two overlap on that sequence; it does
//                     not show the lookup term independently necessary.
// +inj_dma_snoop: drop the snoop's invalidate for exactly as long as a
// posted store is pending -- the failure T15 exists to catch, "the chipset
// wrote memory and the CPU never learned of it because it was busy
// draining a write of its own".  T15 must FAIL under this; if it does not,

	// their four tags with the way associations rotated by one.  If the
	// blinded acceptance term lets that row reach the fill's writeback, each
	// of the four now answers from the way holding its neighbour's data.
	//
	// RESULT: no counterexample, and it is not the acceptance term that
	// saves it.  The experiment fires -- 8 collisions with the permuted row,
	// one on an acceptance cycle -- and the four lines read back correctly
	// with +inj_acc_whole, +inj_look_whole and +inj_fillguard blinded in
	// every combination.  Two observations from +trace_wb: of the 8 writeback
	// attempts while the row was armed, 6 were blocked by fill_snooped and 2
	// wrote, so the writeback guard is real and does act here; and blinding
	// it as well still produces nothing, so it is not the whole story either.
	// The rest is that the permuted row does not carry the REQUESTING line's
	// tag, so the lookup misses and refills from a row that has since been
	// re-read clean.  This route is doubly protected and hard to reach.
	//
	// The divide-1 acceptance term is load-bearing on the LOOKUP route
	// instead, which T13 below demonstrates.  T12 stays as a positive
	// regression over the writeback route.
