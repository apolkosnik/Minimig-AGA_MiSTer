// split the 1010/1111-top-nibble opcode classes into their own A-line/     //
// F-line vectors (10/11) instead of folding them into ILLEGAL -- not done  //
// here because nothing in this decoder's current scope actually produces   //
// those top nibbles, so there is no test coverage to verify the split      //

// read at all -- the only thing decode contributes beyond recognizing the   //
// opcode is computing the actual vector NUMBER (32+n) into id_imm, reused    //
// exactly the way BSR/JMP/JSR already reuse it for a displacement (a          //
// "general-purpose field", per MOVE.L (d16,An),Dn's header note) rather        //
// than adding a dedicated port for one 8-bit value. Like BSR/JSR, decode        //

// Illegal instruction (milestone 14, new): id_is_illegal is precisely the   //

// first time) actually threaded downstream, since ap040_ea_fetch.v's           //
// exception-entry sequencer is now a real consumer, not a future one. Also       //
// points id_dest_reg at A7/sets id_writes_reg, same shape as TRAP -- an           //
// illegal-instruction exception pushes a frame and decrements A7 too, per         //
// ap040_core.v's go_illegal task (format $0, vector 4). The one difference         //
// from TRAP: the frame's stacked PC is the illegal instruction's OWN address        //
// (id_pc), not the following instruction's (id_next_pc) -- you can't "return         //
// past" an illegal opcode the way TRAP's handler returns past the TRAP itself;        //
// see ap040_ea_fetch.v's header for where that distinction is actually applied.        //

// long gather AND its speculative decode-time redirect verbatim -- BSR is    //
// UNCONDITIONALLY taken (like BRA's cond_true(0)==1 always), so decode's      //
// "assume taken" guess is always correct and needs no EX-side correction.     //
// Kept as its own id_is_bsr flag rather than folded into id_is_branch,         //
// though, because ap040_execute.v's Bcc path checks cond_true(eaf_cond) --      //
// and BSR's condition-code field bits (0001, the literal "F" encoding) would     //
// make that check ALWAYS evaluate false and wrongly fire a misprediction if       //
// BSR were misclassified as a plain branch. Verified against ap040_core.v's        //

//  - This gather must NOT trigger IF's speculative redirect. Every prior        //

//    correctness bug (confirmed by mutation-testing the guard back out; see       //
//    ap040_execute.v-adjacent test notes / AP040_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).          //

// harmless-because-unused for everything else -- until ap040_ea_fetch.v             //
// started actually ADDING eac_imm to the address this milestone. MOVE.L             //

// The_68040_processor_I_Design_and_impleme.pdf describes an 8-word buffer  //
// and a 3-word decode window; disproportionate to what's needed here and   //
// not what section 16's "architecturally-equivalent, not cycle-exact"      //
// non-goal calls for). Instead, THIS stage recognizes when it needs more   //
// words than the one it's looking at, and spends the next 1-2 cycles       //
// treating ap040_inst_fetch.v's incoming words as extension DATA rather    //

// Two facts this relies on, verified against ap040_core.v's own            //
// implementation rather than assumed:                                      //
//  - the branch-displacement base is ALWAYS opcode_pc + 2 regardless of     //
//    form (ap040_core.v's br_base <= pc is captured at the same decode      //
//    instant for all three forms, before any extension word is fetched) --  //
//    so only the displacement's width/source changes between forms, not     //
//    the base formula Bcc.B already uses.                                   //
//  - word order for the 32-bit form is high-word-first: ap040_core.v:1817's //
//    imm <= {imm[15:0], epf_data[...]} shifts each new word in as the new   //
//    low half, so the first-fetched word becomes the high half once the     //

// id_next_pc (new this milestone, every instruction not just branches):     //

// ap040_execute.v's fall-through/recovery address (eaf_pc + 2) was correct  //
// only by coincidence of scope. A 2-/3-word Bcc breaks that. The general    //
// fix -- needed for every future variable-length instruction, not just      //

// always-true case of the SAME Bcc mechanism -- ap040_core.v:4802-4819's   //
// 4'h6 decode calls one shared finish_bcc(target, cond_true(ir[11:8])) for //
// every condition code including T (ir[11:8]==0). This decoder does the    //
// same: id_redirect_valid/id_redirect_pc fire COMBINATIONALLY the instant   //
// the full displacement is known -- immediately, from if_opcode alone, for  //
// the byte form (same cycle it's fetched, before it's even latched into     //
// id_*); on the gather-completing cycle for the word/long forms -- for      //
// EVERY branch regardless of its actual condition, the "always assume       //
// taken" policy the real 68040 uses. For BRA (cond_true(0)==1 always) the   //
// guess is always right and nothing downstream ever needs to correct it.    //
// For a real Bcc, the guess can be wrong; id_is_branch/id_cond are threaded //
// onward (through ap040_ea_calc.v/ap040_ea_fetch.v unchanged) so            //
// ap040_execute.v can check the real condition once CCR forwarding actually //
// has something to forward (see its header comment for why EX, not here,   //
// is where that check has to happen) and signal a flush back through this  //
// stage's `flush` input if the guess was wrong.                            //
//                                                                          //
// Scc.B Dn shares id_cond's field position with Bcc (both put the 4-bit     //
// condition at if_opcode[11:8]), so it reuses id_cond directly -- no new    //
// condition field, and ap040_execute.v's cond_true() (all 16 encodings,     //
// not a subset) is reused by both consumers as-is. Scc's dest register is   //
// at if_opcode[2:0], NOT if_opcode[11:9] like MOVEQ/MOVE.L/ADD.L's dest --  //
// for Scc that upper field is the condition code instead -- so             //
// id_dest_reg's source is a per-opcode mux, the same shape id_alu_op        //

//
// Three things make it different from every ALU form so far:
//
//  - The destination is An, and the write is ALWAYS 32 bits wide. ADDA.W
//    updates the whole address register, not its low half.
//  - ADDA and SUBA set NO condition codes at all. CMPA does -- it is a
//    compare -- and writes no register, the same split CMP already has.
//  - The Word form SIGN-EXTENDS its source to 32 bits and then operates on
//    the full width. Nothing in this pipeline did that before: id_size has
//    always meant one width for the memory access AND the ALU, and here
//    those differ. id_sxt_w carries the difference -- it forces a Word-sized
//    read (and a Word-sized auto-increment step) while id_size stays Long
//    for the ALU, and sign-extends whatever the source turned out to be.
//    Zero-extending instead is a silently wrong answer for any negative
//    offset, which is most of what SUBA is used for.
//
// Source modes here are the five that need no extension word: Dn, An, (An),
// (An)+ and -(An). The gathering modes -- (d16,An) and, most valuable of
// all, #imm, which is how a stack frame is opened and closed -- are the

// Operand roles: ir[11:9] is the SOURCE data register and mmm/rrr the

//         mem[A7-4] <- An ;  An <- A7-4 ;  A7 <- A7-4+d16
// UNLK  undoes it:
//         An <- mem[An] ;  A7 <- An+4
//
// Both write TWO registers, which is what makes them fit: milestone 30's
// second write port already exists for autoincrement and is free here,
// because neither instruction autoincrements. LINK's memory write reuses
// eac_is_push, the BSR/JSR path, whose address is already operand_b - 4 --
// so pointing eac_dest_reg at A7 makes push_addr come out right with no new
// arithmetic. Only the pushed DATA is new: BSR pushes eac_next_pc, LINK
// pushes the old An.
//
// UNLK needs no new memory path at all: a plain load through
// mem_issue/mem_complete with An as both the address and the destination.
//
// LINK is the TENTH gather kind, and as the plan predicted after milestone
// 46 it carries its own properties rather than inferring them from shape.
// MOVEM.L (milestone 50), the two autoincrement forms -- which are the
// prologue/epilogue idiom and the reason the instruction matters:
//
//   MOVEM.L <list>,-(An)   $48E0+n   registers to memory, predecrementing
//   MOVEM.L (An)+,<list>   $4CD8+n   memory to registers, postincrementing
//
// An extension word carries a 16-bit register MASK, and the instruction is
// genuinely multi-cycle: one memory access per set bit, up to sixteen. It
// gets a sequencer in ap040_ea_fetch.v alongside the exception-frame and
// RTE ones, and a THIRD register write port, because one instruction
// writing sixteen registers cannot use a writeback path that carries one
// result per instruction.
//
// The mask is numbered differently in the two directions, which is the
// detail worth stating once rather than rediscovering: for the
// predecrementing store, bit 0 is A7 and bit 15 is D0, so walking the mask
// from bit 0 upward stores A7 first at the highest address; for every other
// mode, including the postincrementing load, bit 0 is D0 and bit 15 is A7.
// Taking lowest-set-bit first in both cases, the register index is
// 15 - bit for the store and bit itself for the load, which is why they
// reverse cleanly into one sequencer.
// MULU.W/MULS.W <ea>,Dn (milestone 51): 1100 DDD 011 mmm rrr and
// 1100 DDD 111 mmm rrr. Nibble 1100 with ir[7:6]==11 is the slot every ALU
// shape above has been excluding -- it is AND's opmode 011/111, which the
// 68k gives to multiply rather than to a second AND direction.
//
// A 16x16 -> 32 multiply is one DSP block and needs no sequencer, so this
// is decode plus two ALU cases. The 32-bit result goes to the whole of Dn,
// which is why id_size is Long while the SOURCE is a word: id_sxt_w forces
// the memory read (and the autoincrement step) to Word, exactly as it does
// for ADDA.W. Its sign extension is irrelevant here in a way worth stating
// -- the ALU reads only bits [15:0] of each operand, so MULU is not made
// signed by arriving sign-extended.
//
// Source modes here are Dn and the three register-indirect ones. An is not
// a legal source for multiply and is excluded by construction.
// DIVU.W/DIVS.W <ea>,Dn (milestone 52): 1000 DDD 011 mmm rrr and
// 1000 DDD 111 mmm rrr -- OR's opmode 011/111, the mirror of multiply's
// slot in nibble 1100.
//
// Unlike multiply, these cannot be combinational: a 32/16 divide is an
// iterative sequencer in ap040_execute.v, which is why it lives there and
// not in ap040_pipe_alu.v. Dn / <ea> gives a 16-bit quotient in Dn[15:0]
// and a 16-bit remainder in Dn[31:16].
//
// They also bring two conditions nothing in this core had before:
//
//   Divisor zero  -> a real EXCEPTION, vector 5. The divisor is known in
//     ap040_ea_fetch.v, so this is detected there and routed through the
//     same dynamic-exception path an odd JMP target already uses, rather
//     than needing anything new.
//   Quotient too wide -> V is set and the destination is left UNCHANGED.
//     That is the first instruction here that can fail without writing
//     anything, and it reuses DBcc's writes_reg_resolved hook.

//   [14:12] index register number         [10:9] scale, 1/2/4/8
//   [7:0]   signed byte displacement

// sign-extended displacement, and ap040_ea_fetch.v decodes it. Packing it
// that way is why no new per-stage fields were needed: the word already is
// the packed form.

// load: eac_src_reg is its An, eac_imm its displacement, brief word or
// absolute, and its (An)+/-(An) update rides the second write port as for
// any load. The DESTINATION is the read-modify-write store with a different
// address: decode points eac_dest_reg at the destination An, which every
// load already reads on port B and nobody used, id_ea_ext carries the
// destination's own extension, and ap040_ea_fetch.v forms that address when
// the load completes and hands it to EX as eaf_ea_target. EX stores the
// ALU_MOVE of the loaded value there, and a destination (An)+/-(An) writes
// its updated An through the main port, which a store leaves free.
//
// The source's extension words arrive first. held_mm_src_ext captures them
// as the last one arrives, because disp_acc only keeps the two words before
// the current one and a (xxx).L -> (xxx).L MOVE is four.
//
// id_mm is {mm, source immediate, destination (An)+, -(An), absolute,
// indexed}; a destination that is none of those is (An) or (d16,An), whose
// extension is zero or the displacement.
