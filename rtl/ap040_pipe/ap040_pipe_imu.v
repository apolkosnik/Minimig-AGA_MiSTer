// (ap040_pipe_membus.v), as the MC68040's IMU sits between its instruction //

// and, behind it, the instruction cache (stage B of                        //

// CPU side: ap040_pipe_l1.v's port-A protocol exactly -- a request, a      //
// return with a valid that holds as a level until the next request, and a  //
// new request abandoning one in flight.                                    //
//                                                                          //
// The prefetch stream (2026-09-24). Fetching one word per transaction, and //
// only once the previous word had been handed over, held the pipeline to 4 //
// cycles per instruction on a zero-wait bus where the sequential core ran  //
// at 2. Fetches are aligned longwords into a four-entry window that runs   //
// ahead of the fetch unit whenever the bus has nothing else to do. A       //
// request inside the window is answered the next cycle -- the timing the   //
// L1 array's port A gives, so ap040_inst_fetch.v issues back to back --    //
// and the window slides forward to it. A request for the longword in       //
// flight waits for it; anything else is a redirect: the window is emptied, //
// the read in flight is discarded when it returns, and the stream restarts //
// at the new address. A CPU write that touches the window or the read in   //
// flight empties it, and the bus controller sends writes before the        //
// refetch, so a store into the instruction stream is fetched -- from       //
// memory; the instruction cache, as the 68040's, does not see CPU writes   //
// (4.5), and with it on a store into cached code needs CINV or CPUSH. A    //
// change of privilege empties the window too, so every word carries its    //
// own function code.                                                       //
//                                                                          //
// Restarts: a redirect can change the request while a read is on the bus.  //
// That transaction cannot be recalled, so its result is discarded and the  //
// new address read -- the fetch unit never sees the stale word.            //
//                                                                          //
// Translation (caches stage A). The window is logical. With pages mapped   //
// (pf_xlat) each read the stream wants is translated through the MMU's     //
// instruction port (x_*) from this unit's own register before it goes on   //
// -- never while holding the bus: the table walker may be waiting for a    //
// write the bus controller has still to send -- and a prefetch in the page //
// the port translated last goes out in its own cycle through the MMU's     //
// peek (pk_*). The translation of a read the window no longer wants is     //
// seen through and then discarded. Each translation carries the page's    //
// caching mode (x_cm, pk_cm); untranslated, the mode is the instruction    //
// TTRs' if one matches, else write-through (4.3).                          //
//                                                                          //
// The window's reads (caches stage B). With CACR IE clear, and the cache   //
// idle, each goes to the bus controller in the cycle the window asks, if   //
// its bus is free (f_free) -- as before the cache: writes and reads beat   //
// fetches, since a fetch can always be re-issued and a load cannot -- and  //
// is answered with f_ack or f_flt. With IE set it goes to the cache, which //
// holds it (lk_*) until it answers:                                        //
//   - a cache-inhibited page's read goes to the bus controller as above;   //
//   - otherwise the set is read the cycle after the request -- from a      //
//     register: the request forms late in the cycle, after port A's        //
//     address -- and compared the cycle after that. A hit answers with     //
//     the half-line (PA3) the longword is in: the longword, and the next   //
//     one when that is in the same half-line, both into the window;        //
//   - a miss reads the line, the longword asked for first and the rest     //
//     wrapping (4.1, 4.6.1), each longword a bus controller read. They are //
//     gathered in the line read buffer (fb), each answers the window's     //
//     read for it as it arrives -- the stream reads a line in the order    //
//     the fill does, from the longword it came in at -- and each half-line //
//     is written to its way once both its longwords are in. The line is    //
//     valid only when all four are: an error on any beat abandons the      //
//     line, faulting only a read waiting for that beat; a read waiting for //
//     another is looked up again, and fills again from its own longword.   //
//   - replacement: the first invalid way of the set, else the way a 2-bit  //
//     counter names -- it counts every half-line looked up, and once more  //
//     after it names a way to replace (4.1).                               //
// A read the window has abandoned (pf_kill) is answered at once, unless    //
// its bus read is out: a miss it would have made is not filled. A fill     //
// already under way is completed, for the line is wanted.                  //
//                                                                          //
// CINV/CPUSH on the instruction cache (cm_*), whatever CACR says: once the //
// cache is idle -- no read held, no fill -- all ways at once, or the line  //
// or 4 KB page at the physical address An gave, each set's tag row read    //
// and the matching ways invalidated; a page is every set, 64 rows. There   //
// is no dirty data here, so CPUSH is CINV. The data cache is the DMU's     //
// (stage C); until then it has nothing to do.                              //
//                                                                          //
// Snoops (sn_*): a write by another master invalidates any line holding    //
// its address, found through the arrays' copy of the tag rows, never the   //
// lookup's port -- captured, its set's row read, compared. A snoop of the  //
// line being read keeps it from being made valid. The copy's row read in   //
// the cycle a fill writes that set's tags is undefined, and the snoop then //
// takes the whole set.                                                     //

// (w_accept) and where the program wrote (w_sla), for the window's snoop.  //
