//                                                                          //
// Between EA-fetch's port B and the bus controller (ap040_pipe_membus.v),  //
// as the MC68040's DMU sits between its operand accesses and its bus       //
// controller (MC68040UM Figure 4-1): operand addresses are translated here //
// by ap040_pipe_mmu.v's data port, and only physical addresses go on.      //
// Stage A of doc_AP040_PIPELINE_CACHES.md put translation here; stage C    //
// the data cache, write-through (below).                                   //
//                                                                          //
// Toward the CPU this is the bus controller's port-B protocol exactly,     //
// which the bus controller implemented while the MMU sat below it: one     //
// read at a time, returned with a valid that holds as a level; writes      //
// posted; a write that translation can refuse (the CPU's l1_wr_sync: TC.E  //
// or a data TTR enabled) is TENTATIVE -- held busy until it passes,        //
// accepted in the cycle wr_busy drops, the refusal a level until the CPU   //
// has let go (c_wr_drop), and the acceptance kept across a cycle the CPU   //
// was not looking (review 16's receipt). Those rules move here with the    //
// translation; the bus controller sees only writes that have passed, and   //
// reports only physical bus errors.                                        //
//                                                                          //
// Translated from registers. The CPU's port-B address settles late in its  //
// cycle, from EA-fetch's stalls; an ATC compare and a physical address     //
// after it do not fit in 25 ns (the first draft, which translated in the   //
// request's own cycle, fitted at -5.3 ns). So with translation able to     //
// refuse (xlat), a request is latched as it arrives and translated from    //
// the latch, and every signal toward the CPU and the MMU comes from        //
// registers: a read goes to the bus controller the cycle after it is       //
// asked for, through its translated-read input (rx_*), which puts it on    //
// the bus in that cycle -- the bus controller's own timing, which took a   //
// read the cycle it came and put it on the bus the next; a write is        //
// accepted the cycle after its translation passes -- a cycle after it is   //
// taken when the MMU's most recent hit covers it, two when its lookup      //
// runs, as the bus controller accepted it. Untranslated (xlat low), reads  //
// and writes go straight through, as they did.                             //
//                                                                          //
// Ordering. A write accepted here goes to the bus controller before any    //
// read that arrives after it: a read waits while the write slot holds      //
// anything, and the bus controller sends the writes it holds before the    //
// reads.                                                                   //
//                                                                          //
// The MMU's data port is held by whoever raised it -- the slot or the read //
// -- at the same address until it passes or faults: a walk cannot be       //
// recalled, and its fault belongs to the access it was for. After a fault  //
// the port is left down for a cycle, which is what the walker waits for    //
// (ap040_pipe_mmu.v's W_DROP).                                             //
//                                                                          //
// Transfers that cross a page with translation on: the two pages are       //
// translated separately and the transfer goes out a byte at a time, each   //
// byte to its own page's physical address, a read's bytes assembled here;  //
// a fault on the second page reports MA. A crossing write is first CHECKED //
// on both pages (the MMU's access check: no M history), so a refused write //
// has written nothing and marked nothing -- as the bus controller's PTEST  //
// probes guaranteed -- then translated for real on each page, which sets   //
// M, and only then accepted and its bytes posted. Every table search a     //
// write needs is thereby over before it is accepted, and the walker never  //
// runs while an accepted write has still to reach memory (wr_pend).        //
//                                                                          //
// MOVES spaces (MC68040UM 3.2, Table 3-2; stage A2). $0, $3, $4 and $7 are //
// alternate address spaces: the address is physical, used without          //
// translation -- no ATC lookup, no search, no protection, no MMU fault --  //
// and not split at a page. $2 and $6 are converted to the data spaces $1   //
// and $5: translated as any data access, and on the bus as data (the bus   //
// controller converts what it is given; this unit its translated reads).   //
//                                                                          //
// The data cache (caches stages C and D; MC68040UM 4). 64 sets of four     //
// 16-byte lines, physically tagged, on stage 0's arrays (a longword a way  //
// a read, byte enables; a tag row a set; the snoop copy); valid bits, a    //
// dirty bit a longword and the replacement counter in flops. CACR DE turns //
// it on; with DE clear every path above is as it was.                      //
//   Reads. Every read is latched and translated (untranslated, the MMU     //
//   passes it at once, with the caching mode a TTR gives, else write-      //
//   through). Its set is read in the cycle its translation passes -- PA9-  //
//   PA2 are the untranslated bits, already in the latch -- and compared    //
//   the next: a hit is answered from the cache, right-aligned by size.     //
//   A miss reads the line, the longword asked for first and the rest       //
//   wrapping, each longword a bus controller read; the first answers the   //
//   read, the rest are handed to later reads of the line as they arrive.   //
//   The line is valid when all four are in; an error on any beat abandons  //
//   it, faulting only the read waiting for that longword.                  //
//   Writes. Written through (CM 00, and every write untranslated with no   //
//   data TTR): sent to the bus controller as they were, each updating a    //
//   line holding it through the byte enables, its dirty bits kept, in the  //
//   order the writes are sent (4.3.1.1; Table 4-4). Copyback (CM 01, the   //
//   translating slot's aligned writes): the write goes to the cache        //
//   instead -- a hit updates the line and marks its longword dirty, a miss //
//   reads the line and then does so, or, allocating nothing, goes to the   //
//   bus alone (4.3.1.2). A write's update waits for a line being read, and //
//   a read's lookup for the update of every write before it.               //
//   Not cached: an access a TTR or page marks inhibited (CM 1x), MOVES to  //
//   an alternate space, a locked access (TAS, CAS, CAS2), a MOVE16 write;  //
//   each pushes a dirty line holding its address -- a write merged into it //
//   first -- and invalidates it (4.3.2, 7.4.5), then goes to the bus. A    //
//   read spanning two longwords, or pages, goes to the bus too, and a      //
//   write that does is written through. Exception frames, the vector fetch //
//   and MOVE16 allocate nothing (4.3.3).                                   //
//   Replacement: the first invalid way, else the counter's, which counts   //
//   every read looked up and every write sent or taken (4.1). A dirty line //
//   replaced is read out through port A before the new one lands on it,    //
//   and its dirty longwords written once the new line is in, ahead of any  //
//   CPU write; no line is read and no read goes to the bus until they are. //
//   If the new line's read errs, the replaced line goes back to its place, //
//   valid and dirty, nothing written (4.6.2; stage R).                     //
//   CINV/CPUSH on the data cache (cm_*), whatever CACR says: all ways, a   //
//   line, or a 4 KB page (64 tag rows), at a physical address; CPUSH       //
//   pushes each dirty line first, CINV drops the dirty data.               //
//   Table searches go through the cache (wk_*): a read uses a hit, a write //
//   (U, M) updates a line holding the descriptor and goes to memory.       //
//   Snoops (sn_*): as the instruction cache's, through the tag copy; a     //
//   dirty line snooped loses its data (the platform's boundary).           //
// A write-back's bus error (caches stage R; MC68040UM 8.4.6). A write is   //
// accepted, and its instruction goes on, long before the bus answers it;   //
// a bus error then has no instruction to fault. The bus controller tells   //
// this unit (m_wberr), which records every write it hands over (hw_*),     //
// the whole write -- a crossing one's bytes are one write -- by its        //
// logical address, a push's by its physical one. The fault is held here    //
// (pw_*) with what its access error frame reports: the SSW; WB1S, WB1A     //
// and WB1D, the data in the byte lanes it was written on (Table 8-5), for  //
// the handler to complete; for a push, WB1S invalid and the line in PD0-   //
// PD3, so the push engine keeps its line until its last write is done;     //
// for MOVE16, TT 1, a line, and its four longwords. EA-fetch takes it at   //
// an instruction boundary (pae_hold) and lets it go (pw_ack). One is held  //
// at a time: another bus error meanwhile is dropped -- the writes behind   //
// the one that erred complete as they would have, where the 68040 would    //
// hand them to the handler in WB2/WB3 -- unless it is an exception         //
// frame's write, which makes the fault held a double fault (pw_exc).       //
