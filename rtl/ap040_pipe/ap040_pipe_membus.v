// CPU side: port B is ap040_pipe_l1.v's protocol exactly -- byte           //
// addresses, a request and a return, one outstanding read, writes posted   //
// behind wr_busy. Port A's side, the prefetch window, is ap040_pipe_imu.v  //
// (2026-09-25, caches stage B), which asks this unit for its reads (f_*).  //
//                                                                          //
// Bus side: rtl/ap040/ap040_core.v's own external port, verbatim, so that  //
// ap040_bus16_adapter.v and the TG68K-shaped wrapper around it can be      //
// attached without reshaping anything: mem_req is held until mem_ack,      //
// mem_ack is a single-cycle pulse with mem_rdata valid, and the requester  //
// drops mem_req in the ack cycle. One transaction at a time; this module   //
// leaves one idle cycle between them rather than holding mem_req high      //
// across a new address, which is what that adapter's "one stable bus       //
// request at a time" contract asks for.                                    //
//                                                                          //
// Ordering: a posted write goes out BEFORE any read that is waiting. The   //
// L1 array answers a read from its write buffer when the two collide;      //
// draining first gets the same answer from memory and needs no forwarding  //
// path here. Reads then beat fetches, because a fetch can always be        //
// re-issued and a load cannot: the IMU's read goes out in the cycle it     //
// asks (f_req) only when the bus is free for it (f_free) -- nothing on it, //
// no write or read waiting -- and is answered with f_ack (mem_rdata) or    //
// f_flt. Every write taken is told to the IMU (w_accept), with the         //
// logical longword the program wrote (w_sla), for its window's snoop.      //
//                                                                          //
// Transaction sizes: data accesses carry the CPU's own size and address,  //
// at whatever alignment, and the adapter below splits them (milestone 86). //
// A fetch is an aligned longword.                                          //
//                                                                          //
// Translation (2026-09-25, caches stage A). On the 16-bit top the MMU is   //
// no longer below this unit. Port B's accesses arrive translated, from the //
// DMU (ap040_pipe_dmu.v); a translated read may take the bus in the cycle  //
