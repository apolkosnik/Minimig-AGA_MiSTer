// AP040_PIPE - MC68040-style pipelined core (milestone 17: address error)       //
//                                                                          //
// ap040_ea_fetch.v - EA-fetch stage                                       //
//                                                                          //
// This is where the pipeline's register forwarding lives. The top-level   //
// regfile (ap040_pipe_core.v, its own ap040_pipe_regfile.v fork) is read    //
// combinationally here on BOTH ports -- port A at eac_src_reg, port B at   //
// eac_dest_reg -- and each resolved, independently, as a flat priority mux //
// rather than a chain of ternaries:                                       //
//                                                                          //
//   ex_fwd_*  the instruction currently in EX (still combinational this   //
//             cycle, not yet committed) -- "producer one stage ahead"     //
//                                                                          //
// Port B (eac_dest_reg) is read unconditionally, for every instruction,   //
// not just ones that need it: it's a pure regfile read with no side       //
// effect, and AP040_ALU_MOVE (MOVEQ/MOVE.L's op) never references its `b` //
// input at all (ap040_pipe_alu.v:139-142), so fetching it for those two is //
// simply unused, not wrong -- and the same is true for a branch, whose      //
// eac_dest_reg field is meaningless leftover bits, harmless because         //
// eac_writes_reg is always 0 for one. Scc, this milestone, is the first     //
// instruction that actually NEEDS port B's value for something other than  //
// forwarding to a later instruction: it's the register Scc's byte-merge     //
// preserves the upper bits of (ap040_execute.v). This is the                //
// generalization the milestone-2 altitude review asked for instead of a     //
// per-opcode special case: adding another instruction needs no new mux      //
// shape here.                                                               //
//                                                                          //
// The other hazard case -- a producer committing to the regfile the exact //
// same cycle a consumer reads it -- does NOT need a second mux on either   //
// port: it's resolved inside ap040_pipe_regfile.v itself (its write-through //
// bypass, unconditional in that file -- see its header). A mutation test    //
// during milestone 2 development confirmed this empirically for port A --   //
// forcing this stage's own would-be WB-forward mux to always miss still     //
// passed, because rdata_a was already correct by the time it got here.      //
// Keeping a second, provably redundant mux here would be dead logic; see    //
// ap040_pipe_core.v for the write-through wiring.                           //
//                                                                          //
// id_is_branch/id_is_scc/id_is_dbcc/id_cond/id_next_pc ride through          //
// unchanged -- this stage has nothing to compute for any of them;            //
// ap040_execute.v is where the condition is actually checked, the Scc merge  //
// actually happens, the DBcc decrement/compare happens, and eaf_next_pc is   //
// finally consumed (as ex_recovery_pc), per its header comment on why.       //
//                                                                          //
// DBcc (milestone 8) needs no new mux shape here either: its loop-counter    //
// register is both eac_src_reg and eac_dest_reg (ap040_decode.v sets both     //
// to the same Dn), so operand_a already resolves to Dn's current,             //
// correctly-forwarded value via the existing port-A priority mux -- exactly   //
// the read a decrement needs, with no dedicated DBcc case added to either     //
// port's select logic.                                                      //
//                                                                          //
// flush: when ap040_execute.v detects a mispredicted branch, everything     //
// speculatively fetched behind it -- including whatever is sitting here -- //
// must be discarded. Same shape as stall_in but forces a bubble instead     //
// of holding.                                                              //
//                                                                          //
// MOVE.L (An),Dn (milestone 9b, new) is this pipeline's first memory read,   //
// and its first genuine stall. The address itself needs NO new logic: An's  //
// value is already what `operand_a` resolves to (decode set eac_src_reg to   //
// An's unified regfile index, see ap040_decode.v's header) -- the SAME       //
// priority mux, with the SAME EX-forward source, that every register-direct  //
// operand has used since milestone 2. What's new is turning that value into  //
// an actual ap040_pipe_l1.v port-B access:                                   //
//                                                                            //
//   mem_issue    (eac_valid && eac_is_mem_src && !mem_pending) -- the cycle  //
//                this stage first sees an unserviced memory instruction.     //
//                l1_addr_b is driven combinationally off operand_a THIS      //
//                cycle (ap040_pipe_l1.v registers l1_q_b from it, valid      //
//                next cycle); eaf_valid goes to 0 (nothing for EX yet); and  //
//                eaf_stall's mem_issue term freezes ap040_ea_calc.v's        //
//                OUTPUT for exactly this one cycle -- not a separate pending-//
//                instruction latch in THIS stage, just reusing the stall     //
//                chain's existing freeze-on-stall_in behavior (every stage    //
//                has had it since milestone 1). That's why eac_* is         //
//                guaranteed to still describe the SAME instruction next      //
//                cycle with no extra bookkeeping here.                       //
//   mem_complete (mem_pending, i.e. the cycle after issuing) -- eac_* is      //
//                still frozen on this same instruction, l1_q_b now holds the  //
//                fetched longword. Finishes exactly like the normal path      //
//                below, except eaf_operand_a comes from l1_q_b instead of     //
//                operand_a/regfile/forwarding. eaf_stall drops (mem_issue is  //
//                false once mem_pending is set), so ap040_ea_calc.v is free   //
//                to advance a NEW instruction into its output starting THIS   //
//                cycle -- the memory latency is hidden from whatever comes    //
//                next, not paid twice.                                       //
//                                                                            //
// L1 addressing: ap040_pipe_l1.v is addressed PC_RESET-relative (see          //
// ap040_inst_fetch.v's header) -- PC_RESET is the L1 window's BASE address,   //
// not "where execution starts" in isolation, and both ports must agree on    //
// it or the "unified" memory silently stops being unified. This stage takes  //
// the SAME PC_RESET parameter ap040_inst_fetch.v does (ap040_pipe_core.v     //
// passes the identical value to both) rather than assuming address 0.        //
//                                                                            //
// MOVE.L (d16,An),Dn (milestone 10, new): needed NO changes to the mem_issue/ //
// mem_complete FSM above -- ap040_decode.v now reuses id_imm to carry the      //
// sign-extended displacement (0 for the plain (An) case), and this stage's     //
// address computation became `operand_a + eac_imm` unconditionally (see        //
// where l1_addr_b is assigned below) rather than a per-mode branch. The         //
// gather that assembles the extension word happens entirely in                  //
// ap040_decode.v, same as Bcc.W/DBcc -- this stage never knows a gather           //
// happened, exactly the same "looks identical from EA-calc onward" property       //
// those two established.                                                          //

// flush: when ap040_execute.v detects a mispredicted branch, everything     //
// speculatively fetched behind it -- including whatever is sitting here -- //

// abandoned, not unwound -- a read has no side effect, so its eventual        //
// l1_q_b is just never consumed once mem_pending clears.                     //
//                                                                            //
// JMP (An) / JMP (d16,An) (milestone 11, new): the EA (operand_a + eac_imm,   //

// as its RESULT, not an address to dereference -- eac_is_mem_src stays 0 for  //
// JMP (ap040_decode.v never sets it), so this stage's mem_issue/mem_complete   //
// FSM never triggers for it and JMP rides the plain, non-stalling "else"       //
// path below like any register-direct instruction. The only change there is    //
// eaf_operand_a: `eac_is_jmp ? (operand_a + eac_imm) : operand_a` -- routing     //
// the computed target into the SAME field ap040_execute.v already reads for      //
// its EX-forward tap and (via a new case there) ex_recovery_pc. See its           //

//   free at all. When wr_stall is false (either this isn't a push, or it is and                 //

// computed right here, the earliest point that value exists, and folds straight            //
// into eac_is_exc/exc_pc_field/exc_vec_num alongside illegal/TRAP (own address,            //
// vector 8, format $0 -- go_priv's exact convention). The frame push itself uses            //
// isp_in/msp_in DIRECTLY, never port B/A7 (see exc_sp_bank below for why: a fault             //
// taken WHILE ALREADY IN USER MODE must still land its frame on a SUPERVISOR                  //
// stack, not USP) -- which also means MOVEC's READ direction pointing port B at                //
// its intended GPR destination for the NORMAL case is fine as-is, no rerouting                  //
// needed there at all. eaf_dest_reg IS still overridden on the COMMIT side once                  //
// exc_vec_done finalizes (A7, not Rn, is what the exception's OWN result writes),                 //
// since that's a genuinely different register than whatever the now-suppressed                    //
// original instruction intended. MOVE-to-SR and MOVEC's WRITE direction never                      //
// needed ANY of this: decode points their eac_dest_reg at A7 unconditionally (same                  //
// "dummy anchor" trick BSR uses) purely so raddr_b's default read is harmless, not                   //
// because anything downstream actually depends on it. Their SR/control-register                      //
// write itself (when NOT faulting) is entirely ap040_execute.v's job -- this stage                     //
// just threads eaf_is_movesr/eaf_is_movec/eaf_movec_dir/eaf_movec_sel through                           //
// unchanged, the same mechanical pass-through every other classification flag gets.                      //

// (A7) with the register hardcoded instead of decoded from opcode bits. The ONLY              //
// addition is mem_complete's eaf_operand_b, which now also has to carry A7's NEW               //
// (post-pop) value forward for the commit -- one ternary, not a new FSM. RTE is                 //
// genuinely new: a privilege-violating RTE (checked exactly like MOVE-to-SR/MOVEC,                //
// via eac_is_priv -- see above) never reaches its own machinery at all, redirected                 //
// into the SAME exception-entry sequencer instead; a supervisor RTE gets its own 2-                 //
// beat READ sequencer (ret_ph/ret_pending/ret_dword0), the mirror image of the                       //
// exception-entry sequencer's own WRITE beats, reading back the exact two dwords a                    //
// format-$0 push wrote. The format nibble in dword1 decides the pop (milestone 76):     //
// $0 is eight bytes, $2/$3 twelve, anything else is a FORMAT ERROR -- vector 14, a       //

// Walking the mask from bit 0 upward is right for BOTH directions once the
// register index is read off correctly: the predecrementing store numbers
// bit 0 as A7, so it stores A7 first at the highest address and the index
// is 15 - bit; the postincrementing load numbers bit 0 as D0 and the index
// IS the bit. That symmetry is why one sequencer covers both.
//
// Stores take one cycle per register when the write buffer is free and
// retry while it is not, exactly as an exception frame beat does. Loads
// drive an address and capture l1_q_b the cycle after, because the L1
// registers its read data -- and the next address goes out in that same
// cycle (restructuring plan, phase 5), so a run of loads is one register
// per cycle rather than one per two. Not past a faulted beat: the fault
// abandons the instruction, and nothing of it may still be on the port.
