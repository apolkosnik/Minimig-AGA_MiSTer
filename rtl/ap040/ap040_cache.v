// under a divided enable the live term may still be settling in the fast

// there and a registered copy of the same state everywhere else.  Between
// ticks the tick-gated state is constant, so the copy is exact from the
// second fast cycle on; in the first it still shows the row the sweep
// cleared on the tick, and a snoop dropped on a row that has just been
// cleared changes nothing.  With ce high every cycle (the legacy clocking)
